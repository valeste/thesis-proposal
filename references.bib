	abstract = {Abstract. This study focuses on recent improvement in epithelial monolayer cultures originating from whole extirpated Botryllus schlosseri (Urochordata) buds. Buds (n = 2,000) were taken at different (‘A’ to ‘D’) blastogenic stages. We tested the suitability of 35 combinations of various substrates and media on attachment, cell spread, epithelial growth frequencies and on monolayer lifespans. Under favorable conditions, cultured buds at blastogenic stages ‘B’ to ‘D’ (but not stage ‘A’) started to attach to the substrates following a 3-day transient period that leads to formation of spheres and attached monolayers. Substrate type is important for the attachment and the development of monolayers. Under various culture conditions, some of stages ‘B’ and ‘C’ buds develop (3–20 days) one or more large (1 mm diameter) spheres. Stage ‘D’ buds develop monolayers (up to 20\% of buds) without going through a sphere phase. Neither spheres nor attached monolayers of epithelium were observed in stage ‘A’ bud cultures. Spheres grew at a rate of 60 µm in diameter per day using specific medium types and did not attach unless the appropriate substrate was present. When attached, epithelial monolayers expanded at a rate of 200 µm in diameter per day, for 3–15 days, and subsequently detached and died. Sixteen types of media were tested. Medium and substrate combinations were found to determine epithelial lifespan. These results revealed significant improvements in the culture of epithelial monolayers from Botryllus palleal buds. However, an early senescence of the developed epithelial sheets (up to two weeks from onset of appearance) may indicate an internal ageing clock that should be taken into consideration in future approaches.},

This study documents the de novo expression of Piwi transcript and protein in extirpated blastogenic stage “D” buds isolated from Botryllus schlosseri colonies that are maintained in vitro, days after the disappearance of corresponding intact zooids in control colonies. Under in vitro conditions, floating buds attach to substrates and develop monolayers of epithelial sheets that live for long periods (compared to intact colonial buds) prior to their deterioration. Here, we further demonstrate that various cell types within floating blastogenic stage “D” buds are labeled as Piwi+, as do other cells that are dispersed over the epithelial sheets (that are Piwi−, representing highly differentiated state), all revealing a surprising new flag for stemness in these tissue fragments that developed exclusively under in vitro conditions. No single permanent cell-line is currently available from colonial tunicates or from other marine invertebrates, since cells stop dividing in vitro within 24–72 h after their isolation and start cellular quiescence. The development of epithelial sheets from isolated Botryllus palleal buds and the recorded molecular stemness flag of various cells, remaining for long periods under in vitro conditions, may pave the way for establishing cell cultures from Botryllus epithelial cells.},

	abstract = {Sedentary shallow water marine organisms acquire numerous protective mechanisms to mitigate the detrimental effects of UV radiation (UV-R). Here we investigated morphological and gene expression outcomes in colonies of the cosmopolitan ascidian Botryllus schlosseri, up to 15-days post UV-B irradiation. Astogeny in Botryllus is characterized by weekly repeating sets of asexual budding, coinciding with apoptotic elimination of functional zooids (blastogenesis). Ten UV-B doses were administered to three clusters: sublethal, enhanced-mortality, lethal (LD50 = 6.048 kJ/m2) which differed in mortality rates, yet reflected similar distorted morphotypes, and arrested blastogenesis, all intensified in the enhanced-mortality/lethal clusters. Even the sub-lethal doses inflicted expression modifications in 8 stress proteins (HSP 90/70 families and NIMA) as well as morphological blastogenesis. The morphological/gene-expression impacts in surviving colonies lasted for 15 days post irradiation (two blastogenic-cycles), where all damaged and arrested zooids/buds were absorbed, after which the colonies returned to their normal blastogenic-cycles and gene expression profiles, and initiated new buds. The above reflects a novel colonial maintenance strategy associated with the disposable-soma tenet, where the ephemeral soma in Botryllus is eliminated without engaging with the costs of repair, whereas other colonial components, primarily the pool of totipotent stem cells, are sustained under yet unknown colonial-level regulatory cues.},

In the 1950's scientists began to study B. schlosseri and soon recognized it as an important model organism for the study of developmental biology and comparative immunology. In this review, we summarize the history of B. schlosseri studies and experiments performed to characterize the colony life cycle and bud development. We describe experiments performed to analyze variations in bud productivity, zooid growth and bilateral asymmetry (i.e., the situs viscerum), and discuss zooid and bud removal experiments that were used to study the cross-talk between consecutive blastogenetic generations and vascular budding. We also summarize experiments that demonstrated that the ability of two distinct colonies to fuse or reject is controlled by a single polymorphic gene locus (BHF) with multiple, codominantly expressed alleles. Finally, we describe how the ability to fuse and create chimeras was used to show that within a chimera somatic and germline stem cells compete to populate niches and regenerate tissue or germline organs. Starting from the results of these 60 years of study, we can now use new technological advances to expand the study of B. schlosseri traits and understand functional relationships between its genome and life history phenotypes.},

	abstract = {Summary Organic osmolytes are small solutes used by cells of numerous water-stressed organisms and tissues to maintain cell volume. Similar compounds are accumulated by some organisms in anhydrobiotic, thermal and possibly pressure stresses. These solutes are amino acids and derivatives, polyols and sugars, methylamines, methylsulfonium compounds and urea. Except for urea, they are often called ‘compatible solutes’, a term indicating lack of perturbing effects on cellular macromolecules and implying interchangeability. However, these features may not always exist, for three reasons. First, some of these solutes may have unique protective metabolic roles, such as acting as antioxidants (e.g. polyols, taurine, hypotaurine), providing redox balance (e.g. glycerol) and detoxifying sulﬁde (hypotaurine in animals at hydrothermal vents and seeps). Second, some of these solutes stabilize macromolecules and counteract perturbants in non-interchangeable ways. Methylamines [e.g. trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)] can enhance protein folding and ligand binding and counteract perturbations by urea (e.g. in elasmobranchs and mammalian kidney), inorganic ions, and hydrostatic pressure in deep-sea animals. Trehalose and proline in overwintering insects stabilize membranes at subzero temperatures. Trehalose in insects and yeast, and anionic polyols in microorganisms around hydrothermal vents, can protect proteins from denaturation by high temperatures. Third, stabilizing solutes appear to be used in nature only to counteract perturbants of macromolecules, perhaps because stabilization is detrimental in the absence of perturbation. Some of these solutes have applications in biotechnology, agriculture and medicine, including in vitro rescue of the misfolded protein of cystic ﬁbrosis. However, caution is warranted if high levels cause overstabilization of proteins.},

Very little is known about this cycle regulation and its control. In this study, the in vitro fate of developing buds and regressing zooids extirpated from Botryllus schlosseri colonies at different blastogenic stages were examined, revealing that stages ‘B’ to ‘D’ buds (but not stage ‘A’ buds) developed new structures under in vitro conditions. These were mainly spheres (up to 1·mm in diameter) and epithelial monolayers around the attached buds. We also found that: (1) when attached spheres and epithelial monolayers appeared, the life expectancy of an isolated bud in vitro reached 50–60 days, ﬁve times the life expectancy of intact, in vivo developing zooids; (2) the life expectancy of in vitro buds that remained unattached to the substrates was at least 150 days; (3) after attaching to the substrates, buds obeyed a newly imposed developmental clock dictating up to 35 survival days for spheres and up to 14 days for epithelial monolayers; (4) the prevailing mode of death in vitro was necrotic, in contrast to the apoptotic mode of zooidal deterioration at the takeover phase of blastogenesis; (5) under in vitro conditions, degenerating zooids surprisingly produced epithelial monolayers within 3 weeks of culturing. Monolayers survived for up to 10 additional days, extending the lifespan of the degenerating zooids from a few hours to up to 1 month. We conclude that under in vitro conditions, not only are the underlying colonial growth mechanisms replaced by different developmental pathways, but also the internal colonial-level clocks programming death, are replaced by a new biological mechanism with different timetables.},

Symbiotic microorganisms are often the real producers of many secondary metabolites initially isolated from marine invertebrates; however, a certain number of them are actually synthesized by the macro-organisms. In this review, we analysed the literature of the years 2010–2019 on natural products (bioactive molecules and biomaterials) from the main phyla of marine invertebrates explored so far, including sponges, cnidarians, molluscs, echinoderms and ascidians, and present relevant examples of natural products of interest to public and private stakeholders. We also describe omics tools that have been more relevant in identifying and understanding mechanisms and processes underlying the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in marine invertebrates. Since there is increasing attention on ﬁnding new solutions for a sustainable large-scale supply of bioactive compounds, we propose that a possible improvement in the biodiscovery pipeline might also come from the study and utilization of aquatic invertebrate stem cells.},

Intercellular bridges between granular pigment cells were established within 24 h. The viability of these cells decreased slowly, and most died within 1 mo. without any sign of cell proliferation. Other cell types remained in an arrested state and were subjected to a weekly medium exchange. Spontaneous cell proliferation was randomly recorded in 6 to 10\% of the wells from 2 wk to 1 mo. This proliferation was followed by the formation of masses of cell clumps, from which uniform hemocytes (5 \#m, lymphocytelike cells) migrated peripherally. Stress conditions, which included longer intervals between medium exchanges and partial medium replacement, increased the probability of cell proliferation. From each proliferating primary culture, we successfully performed up to 10 plating cycles over a period of 15 wk, during which the cells differentiate in size but are uniformly structured. This produced the first BotryUuslymphocytelike cell line. From this stage, cell numbers remained constant for up to 6 mo. without increase in cell number. Several mitogenic factors were employed on primary cultures. BotryUusand sea cucumber hemolymphs and mixed interleukins were found to augment significantly prohferation of at least one specific cell size, whereas cells were not markedly responsive to lectins (Concavalin A, wheat germ agglutinin, Ulex europaeus agglutinin), insulin, and retinoic acid. The results are discussed with respect to future efforts in the development of tunicate blood cell cultures.},

A total of more than 1,600 embryos, collected from different colonies at various stages of blastogenic cycles, were used in ten experiments (up to 350 embryoslexperiment). Embryos were fully dissociated by mechanical or chemical treatments. In three experiments we succeeded in initiating continuous cell lines from embryonic tissue (designated NIO-BSE-1 to -3). Using different substrates and supplements, we found that embryonic cells cultured in botryllid cell culture medium (Rinkevich and Rabinowitz, 1993) supplemented with either chick embryo extract or heat inactivated Bofrylloides hemolymph and on plastic or gelatin coated substrates may acquire cell-line characteristics. Tunic cells of maternal origin were found in all wells of primary cultures but subsequently disappeared. These cultures grew slowly for the first several weeks, but after transfer to 25 ml culture flasks, proliferation accelerated. When co-cultured with freshly collected blood cells from allogeneic colonies, the embryo-derived cells exhibited antibacterial properties. Two of the cell lines were frozen for future experiments. By using 24-well culture plates and 1-8 embryoslwell under aseptic conditions (produced by a cocktail of antibiotics), almost 100\% of 399 embryos at all developmental stages successfully metamorphosed and produced oozooids under those in vitro conditions. The oozooids could be obtained in vitro without feeding up to 40 days. Retinoic acid and different illumination regimens shorten the time for metamorphosis and improve the state of oozooids' health. The potential use of the embryo-derived cell cultures and the in vino culture of metamorphosed larvae for studying developmental biology and organogenesis of colonial protochordates is discussed.},

	abstract = {Botryllus schlosseri is a colonial urochordate that follows the chordate plan of development following sexual reproduction, but invokes a stem cell-mediated budding program during subsequent rounds of asexual reproduction. As urochordates are considered to be the closest living invertebrate relatives of vertebrates, they are ideal subjects for whole genome sequence analyses. Using a novel method for high-throughput sequencing of eukaryotic genomes, we sequenced and assembled 580 Mbp of the B. schlosseri genome. The genome assembly is comprised of nearly 14,000 intron-containing predicted genes, and 13,500 intron-less predicted genes, 40\% of which could be confidently parceled into 13 (of 16 haploid) chromosomes. A comparison of homologous genes between B. schlosseri and other diverse taxonomic groups revealed genomic events underlying the evolution of vertebrates and lymphoid-mediated immunity. The B. schlosseri genome is a community resource for studying alternative modes of reproduction, natural transplantation reactions, and stem cell-mediated regeneration.
          , 
            The tunicates are an evolutionary group that includes species such as sea squirts and sea tulips. Their name comes from the structure known as a ‘tunic’ that surrounds their sac-like bodies. As marine filter feeders, tunicates obtain nutrients by straining food particles from water, and they can live either alone or in colonies depending on the species. Charles Darwin suggested that tunicates may be the key to understanding the evolution of vertebrates, and indeed today they are regarded as the closest living relatives of this group.
            Colonial tunicates can reproduce either sexually, or asexually by budding. Compatible colonies have the ability to recognize one another and to fuse their blood vessels to form a single organism, whereas incompatible colonies reject one another and remain separate. This recognition process bears some resemblance to the rejection of foreign organ transplants in mammals.
            Here, Voskoboynik and co-workers present the first genome sequence of a colonial tunicate, Botryllus schlosseri. They used a novel sequencing approach that significantly increased the length of a DNA molecule that can be determined by next-generation sequencing, and allowed large DNA repeat regions to be easily resolved. In total, they sequenced 580 million base pairs of DNA, which they estimate contains roughly 27,000 genes.
            By comparing the B. schlosseri genome with those of a number of vertebrates, Voskoboynik et al. identified multiple B. schlosseri genes that also participate in the development and functioning of the vertebrate eye, heart, and auditory system, as well as others that may have contributed to the evolution of the immune system and of blood cells. The genome of B. schlosseri thus provides an important new tool for studying the genetic basis of the evolution of vertebrates.},

Currently, over 98\% of all cell lines are of mammalian origin, which represent only 0.4\% of the extant identiﬁed metazoan evolution. In particular, aquatic invertebrates as a whole show the largest biodiversity and the widest phylogenetic radiation on Earth but have not yet signiﬁcantly contributed to cell lines. Yet, with over 500 publications since the 1960s, the current lack of cell lines does not result from a lack of attempts at cultivating these cells but rather from fragmented research eﬀorts in highly taxonomically diverse model species, a paucity in reports of negative results and persistent knowledge gaps in their in vitro metabolic requirements. To promote the establishment of aquatic invertebrate cell lines, there is thus a need for comprehensive knowledge mapping across taxa to identify adequate, possibly cell type-speciﬁc, protocols. Here, we review strategies for preparing an optimal inoculum, for optimizing culture conditions and for cell lineage authentication to monitor the quality of cell cultures. Finally, we conclude with our view on promising research perspectives towards establishing aquatic invertebrate cell lines.},

The arguments either way do not address the question whether there are short-term goals within rather than external to organisms. Organisms and their interacting populations have evolved mechanisms by which they can harness blind stochasticity and so generate rapid functional responses to environmental challenges. They can achieve this by re-organising their genomes and/or their regulatory networks. Epigenetic as well as DNA changes are involved. Evolution may have no foresight, but it is at least partially directed by organisms themselves and by the populations of which they form part. Similar arguments support partial direction in the evolution of behavior.},

However, it is critical to conceptually understand how cells respond to stress in a holistic sense and to point out how fundamental aspects of the CSR framework are integrated. It was necessary to be extremely selective and not feasible to even mention many interesting and important developments in this expansive field. The purpose of this overview is to sketch out general and emerging CSR concepts with an emphasis on the initial cellular strain resulting from stress (macromolecular damage) and the evolutionarily most highly conserved elements of the CSR. Examples emphasize fish and aquatic invertebrates to highlight what is known in organisms beyond mammals, yeast, and other common models. Nonetheless, select pioneering studies using canonical models are also considered and the concepts discussed are applicable to all cells.

	abstract = {▪ Abstract  The cellular stress response is a universal mechanism of extraordinary physiological/pathophysiological significance. It represents a defense reaction of cells to damage that environmental forces inflict on macromolecules. Many aspects of the cellular stress response are not stressor specific because cells monitor stress based on macromolecular damage without regard to the type of stress that causes such damage. Cellular mechanisms activated by DNA damage and protein damage are interconnected and share common elements. Other cellular responses directed at re-establishing homeostasis are stressor specific and often activated in parallel to the cellular stress response. All organisms have stress proteins, and universally conserved stress proteins can be regarded as the minimal stress proteome. Functional analysis of the minimal stress proteome yields information about key aspects of the cellular stress response, including physiological mechanisms of sensing membrane lipid, protein, and DNA damage; redox sensing and regulation; cell cycle control; macromolecular stabilization/repair; and control of energy metabolism. In addition, cells can quantify stress and activate a death program (apoptosis) when tolerance limits are exceeded.},

Taking an organ systems approach, this review summarizes efforts to establish molluscan cell cultures and describes the varied applications of primary cell cultures in research. Because of the unique status of the Bge cell line, an account is presented of the establishment of this cell line, and of how these cells have contributed to our understanding of snail host-parasite interactions.

              Organisms that have evolved alternative modes of reproduction, complementary to the sexual mode, are found across metazoans. The chordate
              Botryllus schlosseri
              is an emerging model for asexual development studies.
              Botryllus
              can rebuild its entire body from a portion of adult epithelia in a continuous and stereotyped process called blastogenesis. Anatomy and ontogenies of blastogenesis are well described, however molecular signatures triggering this developmental process are entirely unknown. We isolated tissues at the site of blastogenesis onset and from the same epithelia where this process is never triggered. We linearly amplified an ultra-low amount of mRNA ({\textless}10ng) and generated three transcriptome datasets. To provide a conservative landscape of transcripts differentially expressed between blastogenic
              vs.
              non-blastogenic epithelia we compared three different mapping and analysis strategies with a
              de novo
              assembled transcriptome and partially assembled genome as references, additionally a self-mapping strategy on the dataset. A subset of differentially expressed genes were analyzed and validated by
              in situ
              hybridization. The comparison of different analyses allowed us to isolate stringent sets of target genes, including transcripts with potential involvement in the onset of a non-embryonic developmental pathway. The results provide a good entry point to approach regenerative event in a basal chordate.},

	abstract = {This review analyzes activities in the field of marine invertebrate cell culture during the years 1999 to 2004 and compares the outcomes with those of the preceding decade (1988 to 1998). During the last 5 years, 90 reports of primary cell culture studies of marine organisms belonging to only 6 taxa (Porifera, Cnidaria, Crustacea, Mollusca, Echinodermata, and Urochordata) have been published. This figure represents a 2-fold increase in the annual number of publications over the decade 1988 to 1998. Three other trends distinguish the two reviewed periods. First, in recent years studies attempting to improve cell culture methodologies have decreased, while interest in applications of already existing methodologies has increased. This reflects the effects of short-term cultures in attracting new researchers and scientific disciplines to the field. Second, only 17.8\% of the recent publications used long-term cultures, compared with 30.0\% of the publications in the previous decade. Third, during recent years research in cell cultures has studied fewer model species more extensively (mainly, Botryllus schlosseri, Crassostrea, Mytilus, Penaeus, and Suberites domuncula), signifying a shift from previous investigations that had studied a more diverse range of organisms. From 1988 to 1998 the phylum Mollusca was the most studied taxon (34.4\%), but recent years have seen more studies of Porifera and Crustacea (30.0\% and 32.2\% of publications) than of Mollusca (21.1\%). Still, not even a single established cell line from any marine invertebrate has yet been made available. However, the use of new cellular, genomic, and proteomic tools may fundamentally change our strategy for the development of cell cultures from marine invertebrates.},

The genetic structure of newly established populations may reveal insights into invasion processes, making population genetics an important tool for understanding current invasion pathways. Here, we studied newly established populations (non-existent {\textless} 10–20 years before the first sample) of the cosmopolitan alien ascidian Botryllus schlosseri in four Puget Sound marinas (Washington, USA) using eight polymorphic microsatellites. Up to seven sampling sessions over a period of 19 years revealed populations with fluctuating allelic richness (AR = 2.693–4.417) and expected heterozy­ gosity (He = 0.362–0.589). The populations were well differentiated on spatial and temporal scales and were subject to moderate genetic drift (Fs’ = 0.027–0.071). The significant heterozygote deficiencies that were ob­ tained, positive inbreeding coefficients (Fis), and population structure measures (Fst) revealed that no population was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Comparing these parameters with those from two Californian sites (Moss Landing and Santa Cruz, 1200 km south, invaded by Botryllus during the 1940s) revealed a connection between Moss Landing and Puget Sound, whereas Santa Cruz remained isolated. On the US West Coast scale, this study revealed no significant difference in introduced population dynamics between recently established populations and those established over 60 years ago, except for fewer alleles and lower He. When comparing ten worldwide sites, only a few microsatellite loci displayed strong regional differences. Globally, the Puget Sound Botryllus populations exhibit genetic characteristics of recently established populations, as they have the lowest number of alleles and lowest genetic indices, further emerging as one of the youngest B. schlosseri populations worldwide.},

            Sponges (Phylum Porifera) are among the oldest Metazoa and considered critical to understanding animal evolution and development. They are also the most prolific source of marine-derived chemicals with pharmaceutical relevance. Cell lines are important tools for research in many disciplines, and have been established for many organisms, including freshwater and terrestrial invertebrates. Despite many efforts over multiple decades, there are still no cell lines for marine invertebrates. In this study, we report a breakthrough: we demonstrate that an amino acid-optimized nutrient medium stimulates rapid cell division in 9 sponge species. The fastest dividing cells doubled in less than 1 hour. Cultures of 3 species were subcultured from 3 to 5 times, with an average of 5.99 population doublings after subculturing, and a lifespan from 21 to 35 days. Our results form the basis for developing marine invertebrate cell models to better understand early animal evolution, determine the role of secondary metabolites, and predict the impact of climate change to coral reef community ecology. Furthermore, sponge cell lines can be used to scale-up production of sponge-derived chemicals for clinical trials and develop new drugs to combat cancer and other diseases.},

In the past year, major improvements include a large expansion of classiﬁcation information available in PANTHER, as well as signiﬁcant enhancements to the analysis tools. Protein subfamily functional classiﬁcations have more than doubled due to progress of the Gene Ontology Phylogenetic Annotation Project. For human genes (as well as a few other organisms), PANTHER now also supports enrichment analysis using pathway classiﬁcations from the Reactome resource. The gene list enrichment tools include a new ‘hierarchical view’ of results, enabling users to leverage the structure of the classiﬁcations/ontologies; the tools also allow users to upload genetic variant data directly, rather than requiring prior conversion to a gene list. The updated coding singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) scoring tool uses an improved algorithm. The hidden Markov model (HMM) search tools now use HMMER3, dramatically reducing search times and improving accuracy of Evalue statistics. Finally, the PANTHER Tree-Attribute Viewer has been implemented in JavaScript, with new views for exploring protein sequence evolution.},

In the current study, gene expression levels from five platforms were integrated to yield a single composite transcriptome profile. The comprehensive and reliable nature of that dataset allows us to study gene coexpression across cancer cell lines.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Hierarchical clustering revealed numerous clusters of genes in which the genes co-vary across the NCI-60. To determine functional categorization associated with each cluster, we used the Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium database and the GoMiner tool. GO maps genes to hierarchically-organized biological process categories. GoMiner can leverage GO to perform ontological analyses of gene expression studies, generating a list of significant functional categories.
Conclusions/Significance: GoMiner analysis revealed many clusters of coregulated genes that are associated with functional groupings of GO biological process categories. Notably, those categories arising from coherent co-expression groupings reflect cancer-related themes such as adhesion, cell migration, RNA splicing, immune response and signal transduction. Thus, these clusters demonstrate transcriptional coregulation of functionally-related genes.},

Therefore, we conducted a literature search of DNA damage associated with Ni exposure and summarized known Ni-caused DNA damage eﬀects. In vitro and vivo studies demonstrated that Ni can induce DNA damage through direct DNA binding and reactive oxygen species (ROS) stimulation. Ni can also repress the DNA damage repair systems, including direct reversal, nucleotide repair (NER), base excision repair (BER), mismatch repair (MMR), homologous-recombination repair (HR), and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathways. The repression of DNA repair is through direct enzyme inhibition and the downregulation of DNA repair molecule expression. Up to now, the exact mechanisms of DNA damage caused by Ni and Ni compounds remain unclear. Revealing the mechanisms of DNA damage from Ni exposure may contribute to the development of preventive strategies in Ni carcinogenicity.},

This review summarizes recent literature investigating Ni toxicity in marine and estuarine invertebrates and ﬁsh. As in freshwater, three main mechanisms of Ni toxicity exist: ionoregulatory impairment, inhibition of respiration, and promotion of oxidative stress. However, unlike in freshwater biota, where mechanisms of toxicity are largely Class-speciﬁc, the delineation of toxic mechanisms between different species is less deﬁned. In general, despite changes in Ni speciation in marine waters, organism physiology appears to be the main driver of toxic impact, a fact that will need to be accounted for when adapting regulatory tools (such as bioavailability normalization) from freshwater to estuarine and marine environments.},

	abstract = {Protein-protein interaction is a common physiological mechanism for protection and actions of proteins in an organism. The identiﬁcation and characterization of protein-protein interactions in different organisms is necessary to better understand their physiology and to determine their efﬁcacy. In a previous in vitro study using mass spectrometry, we identiﬁed 43 proteins that interact with histatin 1. Six previously documented interactors were conﬁrmed and 37 novel partners were identiﬁed. In this tutorial, we aimed to demonstrate the usefulness of the STRING database for studying protein-protein interactions. We used an in-silico approach along with the STRING database (http://string-db.org/) and successfully performed a fast simulation of a novel constructed histatin 1 protein-protein network, including both the previously known and the predicted interactors, along with our newly identiﬁed interactors. Our study highlights the advantages and importance of applying bioinformatics tools to merge in-silico tactics with experimental in vitro ﬁndings for rapid advancement of our knowledge about proteinprotein interactions. Our ﬁndings also indicate that bioinformatics tools such as the STRING protein network database can help predict potential interactions between proteins and thus serve as a guide for future steps in our exploration of the Human Interactome.},

	abstract = {Fish cell cultures are becoming more widely used models for investigating molecular mechanisms of physiological response to environmental challenge. In this study, we derived two immortalized Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) cell lines from brain (OmB) and lip epithelium (OmL), and compared them to a previously immortalized bulbus arteriosus (TmB) cell line. The OmB and OmL cell lines were generated without or with Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor/3T3 feeder layer supplementation. Although both approaches were successful, ROCK inhibitor/feeder layer supplementation was found to offer the advantages of selecting for epithelial-like cell type and decreasing time to immortalization. After immortalization (\$ passage 5), we characterized the proteomes of the newly derived cell lines (OmB and OmL) using LCMS and identified several unique cell markers for each line. Subsequently, osmotolerance for each of the three cell lines following acute exposure to elevated sodium chloride was evaluated. The acute maximum osmotolerance of these tilapia cell lines (.700 mOsm/kg) was markedly higher than that of any other known vertebrate cell line, but was significantly higher in the epithelial-like OmL cell line. To validate the physiological relevance of these tilapia cell lines, we quantified the effects of acute hyperosmotic challenge (450 mOsm/kg and 700 mOsm/kg) on the transcriptional regulation of two enzymes involved in biosynthesis of the compatible organic osmolyte, myo-inositol. Both enzymes were found to be robustly upregulated in all three tilapia cell lines. Therefore, the newly established tilapia cells lines represent valuable tools for studying molecular mechanisms involved in the osmotic stress response of euryhaline fish.},

	abstract = {Legacy and current-use contaminants enter into and accumulate throughout the San Francisco Bay−Delta (Bay−Delta), and are present at concentrations with known effects on species important to this diverse watershed. There remains major uncertainty and a lack of focused research able to address and provide understanding of effects across multiple biological scales, despite previous and ongoing emphasis on the need for it. These needs are challenging specifically because of the established regulatory programs that often monitor on a chemical-by-chemical basis, or in which decisions are grounded in lethality-based endpoints. To best address issues of contaminants in the Bay−Delta, monitoring efforts should consider effects of environmentally relevant mixtures and sub-lethal impacts that can affect ecosystem health. These efforts need to consider the complex environment in the Bay−Delta including variable abiotic (e.g., temperature, salinity) and biotic (e.g., pathogens) factors. This calls for controlled and focused research, and the development of a multi-disciplinary contaminant monitoring and assessment program that provides information across biological scales. Information gained in this manner will contribute toward evaluating parameters that could alleviate ecologically detrimental outcomes. This review is a result of a Special Symposium convened at the University of California−Davis (UCD) on January 31, 2017 to address critical information needed on how contaminants affect the Bay−Delta. The UCD Symposium focused on new tools and approaches for assessing multiple stressor effects to freshwater and estuarine systems. Our approach is similar to the recently proposed framework laid out by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) that uses weight of evidence to scale toxicological responses to chemical contaminants in a laboratory, and to guide the conservation of priority species and habitats. As such, we also aimed to recommend multiple endpoints that could be used to promote a multi-disciplinary understanding of contaminant risks in Bay−Delta while supporting management needs.},

	abstract = {Background: Tunicates are the closest relatives of vertebrates and are widely used as models to study the evolutionary developmental biology of chordates. Their phylogeny, however, remains poorly understood, and to date, only the 18S rRNA nuclear gene and mitogenomes have been used to delineate the major groups of tunicates. To resolve their evolutionary relationships and provide a first estimate of their divergence times, we used a transcriptomic approach to build a phylogenomic dataset including all major tunicate lineages, consisting of 258 evolutionarily conserved orthologous genes from representative species.
Results: Phylogenetic analyses using site-heterogeneous CAT mixture models of amino acid sequence evolution resulted in a strongly supported tree topology resolving the relationships among four major tunicate clades: (1) Appendicularia, (2) Thaliacea + Phlebobranchia + Aplousobranchia, (3) Molgulidae, and (4) Styelidae + Pyuridae. Notably, the morphologically derived Thaliacea are confirmed as the sister group of the clade uniting Phlebobranchia + Aplousobranchia within which the precise position of the model ascidian genus Ciona remains uncertain. Relaxed molecular clock analyses accommodating the accelerated evolutionary rate of tunicates reveal ancient diversification ({\textasciitilde} 450–350 million years ago) among the major groups and allow one to compare their evolutionary age with respect to the major vertebrate model lineages.
Conclusions: Our study represents the most comprehensive phylogenomic dataset for the main tunicate lineages. It offers a reference phylogenetic framework and first tentative timescale for tunicates, allowing a direct comparison with vertebrate model species in comparative genomics and evolutionary developmental biology studies.},

	abstract = {Colonial tunicates are the only chordate that possess two distinct developmental pathways to produce an adult body: either sexually through embryogenesis or asexually through a stem cell-mediated renewal termed blastogenesis. Using the colonial tunicate Botryllus schlosseri, we combine transcriptomics and microscopy to build an atlas of the molecular and morphological signatures at each developmental stage for both pathways. The general molecular proﬁles of these processes are largely distinct. However, the relative timing of organogenesis and ordering of tissue-speciﬁc gene expression are conserved. By comparing the developmental pathways of B. schlosseri with other chordates, we identify hundreds of putative transcription factors with conserved temporal expression. Our ﬁndings demonstrate that convergent morphology need not imply convergent molecular mechanisms but that it showcases the importance that tissue-speciﬁc stem cells and transcription factors play in producing the same mature body through different pathways.},
